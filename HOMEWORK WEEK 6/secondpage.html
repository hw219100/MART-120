        <h1>This is my dog Lulu</h1>
        <p>My dog is a two-year-old golden retriever. I saw an ad online for puppies and I decided that I would just go and look at them not buy one. However when Lulu untied my shoe lace I knew I needed to get her. As soon as I brought her home she immediately dug up all my flower pots and then continued to take a nap in one. Lulu has a lot of energy which often gets her into trouble. One time she ate an entire pizza of the counter and got so sick! When she is not getting into trouble she loves playing fetch and swimming. Her favorite toy is a lobster plushy. She tears up most of her toys but she loves the lobster plushy so much that it is in perfect condition. Most pepole say not to get a dog in your early twenties but I think its the best decision Iv'e ever made!</p>
